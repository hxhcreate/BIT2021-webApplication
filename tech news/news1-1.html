  <div class="row g-8">
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p align="">According to techcrunch, Jolla, a start-up company from Finland, has finally made a profit this year after ten years of hard work.</p>
        <p>Jolla is the company behind sailfish OS, an Android alternative based on Linux. Everyone who has survived knows how much bitterness and sweat there is behind the word "persistence". For the start-up team, countless engineers make profits today ten years later with their best youth and unremitting efforts, which is undoubtedly the greatest recognition of their products in the market. At the same time, from Jolla's successful course, I also hope to bring you some reference.</p>

        <h2>Origin of Jolla and sailfish OS</h2>







          <p>Jolla company was founded in the mobile Internet scuffle period. More accurately, it should be the second half of the mobile operating system innovation - in 2011, its founder was the MeeGo team from Nokia.</p>

          <p>Many people must be familiar with MeeGo operating system, which is one of the key projects of Nokia in the later stage.</p>

          <p>In the early stage of smart phones in 2005, Nokia led n series (N90, N91, N70) to create a precedent for smart phones. This innovation not only made it rush to the peak of the mobile phone market, but also made its built-in Symbian system quickly monopolize the mobile phone operating system market.</p>

        </blockquote>
          <p>However, the glory of that time now seems to be only the dusk before the collapse of the Empire.</p>

          <p>However, according to the view of then Nokia CEO yoma Ollila, "the mobile phone that can provide users with the best use experience will be the winner. In this battle, the operating system is the core of everything." It is also an interpretation of the battle by competitors interested in the smartphone market, including Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the other side of the Atlantic and Larry Page, one of the founders of Google.</p>

          <p>We know how deep the water in the mobile smartphone market is and how important the operating system is. Finally, the battle for the smartphone market has evolved into the battle for the core operating system. The key depends on who can take the lead. So, in 2005, Google quietly acquired Android, a start-up company, and apple is also quietly devoting itself to developing its own technology. In 2007, apple made an amazing debut with the first generation of iPhone, and the IOS operating system called "iPhone runs OS X" by jobs, removed the physical keyboard and stylus, and brought multi task processing function; Subsequently, Google officially announced the Android operating system and formed an open mobile phone alliance with 84 mobile phone manufacturers, software developers, telecom operators and chip manufacturers in the industry to jointly develop the Android open source mobile system; At the same time, Microsoft is also accelerating the implementation of Windows Mobile 6.0.</p>

            <p>At this time, Nokia is still "can Symbian be highly competitive in the software field?" In the doubt, it gradually lost its dominant power and changed from initiative to change. Until May 2010, it cooperated with Intel to launch MeeGo, hoping to fight again in the mobile market.</p>

          <p>MeeGo combines Nokia's Maemo operating system and Intel's Moblin operating system. It aims to become a platform running on mobile phones, communication and entertainment devices, netbooks, televisions and other hardware. However, at this time point in 2010, when IOS and Android have almost stood firm, we all know that MeeGo has little chance of winning. In addition, Nokia itself is constantly making strategic adjustments, and it has actively migrated from the original Symbian platform to the windows phone platform. Intel, another partner, also announced that it had abandoned MeeGo, which continued to move forward when it could not see the future.</p>

          <p>In 2012, Nokia started layoffs due to its continuous losses and sharp decline in share price, and all employees responsible for MeeGo left, which also means that MeeGo, which was born only two years ago, died. However, the engineers who accompanied MeeGo operating system to grow together at that time did not want to give up. In order to avoid the public relations crisis caused by layoffs, Nokia launched a bridge plan to selectively support some former Nokia employees to establish new companies and help them survive and develop, including later Jolla founders Marc Dillon and Jussi hurmola.</p>

          <p>After coming out of Nokia, Marc Dillon and Jussi hurmola established Jolla company, with MeeGo's independent open source branch mer as the core, and developed an open source operating system based on Linux - sailfish OS.</p>

          <p>Thus, a new journey belonging to sailfish OS also began.</p>




        <h2>How does Jolla make money?</h2>


          <p>It is not a day to make profits at the end of the decade, but what way does Jolla make profits?</p>

          <p>In this regard, Jolla officially described 2020 as the "turning point" of the business - revenue increased by 53% year-on-year, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) was 34%.</p>




        <h2>Enter the automotive field</h2>


          <p>Appsupport for Linux platforms can provide independent compatibility with Android applications for the Linux platform, and users do not need to obtain a complete sailfish OS license, which is the latest research and development direction of Jolla company.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <!--          <img src="../images/learning_img/learning1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Geek" height="200%" width="100%">-->
            <img src="news/1.1.2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Geek" height="200%" width="100%">
        </blockquote>
          <p>Jolla said that appsupport has attracted "strong" interest from some automobile companies in the early stage of its establishment, and these automobile companies are also looking for solutions for some on-board infotainment systems, The companies pointed out that "the digital cockpit is the key difference between cars - it is also an important strategic part that can enable carmakers to open the gap and control market dominance."</p>

          <p>In this regard, pienim ä ki said: "it can be said that the automotive field has developed rapidly in the past few years. Innovators like Tesla have really shocked the whole industry. Therefore, traditional suppliers need to think about their user experience methods and types in different ways and provide different user experiences in the cockpit."</p>

          <p>At present, appsupport can provide an embedded Linux compatible platform used by the system that can run Android applications without selecting the on-board solution provided by Google. Based on this, Jolla also provides users with an alternative to "go to Google".</p>

          <p>In addition, the embedded Linux system can also run in many other places and meet a wider range of needs. For example, the software can enable Internet of things devices to run very mainstream applications.</p>

          <p>Sami pienim ä Ki, co-founder and CEO of Jolla, said, "Jolla did a good job. I'm glad to see Jolla officially turn loss into profit last year. From 2019 to 2020, our revenue increased by more than 50% and our revenue was € 5.4 million. At the same time, the cost base of operation has been quite stable, so these sums have brought good profitability. "</p>


        <h2>Is there an opportunity for traditional operating system manufacturers to rely on smart cars?</h2>


          <p>If sailfish OS has been running Android for ten years, and has finally explored its own way of operation at present, and wants to fully enter the automotive field in the digital transformation in the next step, the experience of an elder is also worth learning.

          <p>According to foreign media reports, as a pioneer of smart phones, the news that "BlackBerry is dead" has been heard by the public countless times. However, after its low-key transformation into a software and service provider, after several years of hard work, BlackBerry has become a pioneer in the field of smart cars, and its software technology has been installed in nearly 200 million cars.

          <p>BlackBerry QNX provides support to many automobile manufacturers such as ampford, BMW, Bosch, Ford, GM, Honda, Mercedes Benz, Toyota and Volkswagen. The cooperation fields include advanced driving assistance system, digital cockpit and data security gateway. BlackBerry's QNX software can track real-time data of Google maps, GPS navigation, traffic monitoring and infotainment systems, which has been embedded in millions of cars on the road.

          <p>Not long ago, blackberry and Amazon jointly established the BlackBerry Ivy, a vehicle data integration and monitoring cloud platform, which is used to improve vehicle safety technology, accelerate the development of autopilot, and even give warning by collecting real-time data and aiming at the dangers of some roads.

          <p>Today, QNX has been installed in 195 million vehicles, which is almost 100 times the number of Tesla vehicles. Relying on automatic driving, blackberry undoubtedly occupies this great advantage.

          <p>Jolla's appsupport is also the underlying software support. We will look forward to whether it will lead the company to a new level.

          <p>Sami pienim ä Ki, co-founder and CEO of Jolla, said, "Jolla did a good job. I'm glad to see Jolla officially turn loss into profit last year.
